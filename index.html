        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music Industry 🎶</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Gavin Manela is a Music Industry student at the University of California, Riverside, with a strong passion for audio production, live sound, and creative media. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Music with a concentration in Music Industry, he is building both the technical expertise and collaborative experience necessary to contribute meaningfully to the evolving music and entertainment landscape. His work reflects a commitment to creative expression, technical growth, and community engagement.
Gavin’s interest in music extends beyond listening; it is rooted in creating, producing, and understanding the technical processes behind sound. He has developed hands-on experience in digital audio production using platforms such as Logic Pro and GarageBand, where he has collaborated with peers to produce original recordings. Through his academic coursework and practical projects, he has gained experience setting up, rigging, and managing PA systems, strengthening his understanding of live sound environments. His long-term goal is to pursue a career in live audio engineering and production, where he can help shape meaningful sonic experiences for audiences.<br><br>

        In addition to his technical development, Gavin has cultivated strong collaborative and interpersonal skills through his involvement in multiple student organizations. As a member of UC Riverside’s Music Enthusiast Society, he contributes to event organization and promotion, helping create opportunities that celebrate diverse musical perspectives and foster community engagement. His participation in Katipunan PSO has further strengthened his ability to work within team-driven creative environments while supporting cultural programming and inclusive campus initiatives.
Gavin also brings a multidisciplinary creative skillset that extends into digital media and design. He is proficient in tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, DaVinci Resolve, and CapCut, allowing him to produce visual content that complements and enhances musical projects. His experience with graphic design, video editing, and social media content creation has strengthened his ability to communicate ideas visually and contribute to cohesive creative projects.<br><br>

        Throughout his academic and extracurricular experiences, Gavin has demonstrated adaptability, initiative, and a strong willingness to learn. He thrives in collaborative settings that require clear communication, attention to detail, and creative problem-solving. Whether producing audio, supporting event logistics, or contributing to creative media projects, he approaches his work with professionalism and enthusiasm.
At his core, Gavin is driven by a deep appreciation for music as both an art form and a technical discipline. He is committed to continuing to develop his technical expertise, creative voice, and professional experience within the music industry. As he progresses in his academic and professional journey, he seeks opportunities that allow him to contribute to live sound production, collaborate with creative teams, and help bring artistic visions to life through sound.
